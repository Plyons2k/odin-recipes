    CSS FOUNDATIONS 
    types of selectors
        universal - (needs a "*") do it to everything on the page
        type - allow to choose any specific element like only headings or only paragraphs
        Class - something within an element so its not always an element but some specific paragraphs or headings
        IDs - only one kind with a # and im still confused with what it is
            .read and .unread - allow to bunch together similar declarations for simplicity
            Chaining selectors - allows to give separate rules to specific elements without repetition
    How do we combine multiple selectors without grouping or chaining selectors?
    decendent combinators 
        allows for any decendent to be selected to have a declaration happen to them
        ex. I can only be chosen if I am under otileia and if not then it wont apply to me
